  "project_6_title": "Football Match Outcome Prediction with Machine Learning",
  "project_6_desc": "Training Machine Learning models to predict football match outcomes using only statistical data.",
  "project_6_details": "This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms to predict football match outcomes (home win, draw, or away win), using the Orange software and a dataset extracted from Kaggle, based on Transfermarkt. Several models were trained, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network, Random Forest, kNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), and Gradient Boosting.",
  "project_6_details_2": "One of the main objectives of this project was to evaluate the performance of these models using only statistical data, without relying on contextual or subjective information, as is the case with betting companies, which include human prediction factors in their calculations. As predictive variables, the last 5 previous results of the teams were considered, both against each other and individually. Training data from 2013 to 2021 was used, testing was done with data from 2022 and 2023, and predictions were made using data from 2024.",
  "project_6_details_3": "The mentioned models were evaluated based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score metrics. The model that achieved the best performance was Gradient Boosting, obtaining the best values for all the mentioned indicators. The confusion matrix also reveals a considerable accuracy of 54.8% in predicting draws, which are traditionally harder to predict due to their unpredictable nature.",
  "project_6_details_4": "For data cleaning and preparation, I used Python, while the machine learning models were trained and evaluated using the Orange software.",
  "project_6_details_5": "In addition to training and evaluating the models, I wrote a detailed article that not only describes the development process but also provides a deeper analysis of the results obtained and their implications in the context of sports outcome prediction. This article can be accessed through the link below.",

  "project_7_title": "ARU - Unique Report Application",
  "project_7_desc": "Data processing software for submitting the Unique Report to Social Security.",
  "project_7_details": "While working at ETLA, I developed a desktop application in C# to automate the data processing required for submitting Annex C of the Unique Report to Social Security (https://help.factorialhr.com/pt_PT/formacao/como-preencher-o-anexo-c-do-relatorio-unico). A process that was previously done through multiple and complex Excel spreadsheets is now simplified with this application.",
  "project_7_details_2": "This application was one of the most challenging in terms of integration with other systems. The data was extracted from various management systems into Excel sheets, so its format and structure were not consistent. ARU was developed with this particularity in mind, and it includes a 'header' reading functionality to attempt to automatically map the input data to the format expected by the application. When the headers are not recognized, the user can manually map the fields, ensuring the necessary flexibility to handle different data sources.",
  "project_7_details_3": "Considering human error as an inevitable factor, the application also includes a duplicate record detection system, alerting the user to possible inconsistencies in the data before generating the final file. After processing and validating the data, the application generates a file in XML format, ready for submission to Social Security, significantly simplifying the process and reducing the risk of errors.",
  "project_7_details_4": "A functionality was also implemented to automatically fill in some form data based on historical data, further reducing the time required to complete the report. This functionality was implemented using a version of the Levenshtein algorithm to compare the names of training sessions given to employees, identifying their topics within those available in the official Social Security table.",
  "project_7_details_5": "For confidentiality reasons, I cannot share screenshots or specific details of the source code for this project.",
  
  "project_8_title": "Balançómetro - Inventory Software for Microbusinesses",
  "project_8_desc": "Simple inventory software for microbusinesses without formal bookkeeping.",
  "project_8_details": "Balançómetro is an inventory software tool I developed to address a need in a family business that did not have formal bookkeeping. Every year, to submit the balance sheet to the Tax Authority, it was necessary to manually inventory all products in stock, which was time-consuming and prone to errors.",
  "project_8_details_2": "An initial solution was simply to create an Excel spreadsheet to make the process easier, but product searches were still slow and imprecise. Better mechanisms for searching and updating the data were needed.",
  "project_8_details_3": "I then built the first version of Balançómetro in C#, with a simple graphical interface that allowed importing the product list exported by the POS system in .xlsx format. The user could then enter current stock quantities, update prices, and generate another Excel sheet ready to be handed over to accounting. The main advantage of this software over a spreadsheet was primarily its search functions, allowing the combination of filters such as price, description, and product code. It may be seen as a simple project, but it still had a major impact on the efficiency of this microbusiness’s annual inventory process.",
  "project_8_details_4": "However, over time, as the number and diversity of products grew, it became clear the software needed improvements to handle these new requirements. So I developed a second version of Balançómetro, incorporating additional features to improve usability and inventory efficiency. This new version uses a more modern stack—Rust, Tauri, and Svelte—to create a lightweight and efficient desktop application and, above all, a cross-platform one, enabling its use on different operating systems. This also sets the stage for the program’s next evolution to be integrated into mobile devices, making the inventory process even easier.",
  "project_8_details_5": "The new features focus mainly on improving the search system by implementing advanced description searches, using techniques such as the Levenshtein algorithm and fuzzy search to find products with similar descriptions, even if they are not exactly the same. This is particularly important for dealing with typos or variations in product naming. There is also search by code and price, both exact and by price ranges. In addition, a feature was implemented that allows mathematical operations to be performed directly in the quantity field, avoiding the need to manually calculate quantities and then replace the value. For example, if a product has 10 units in stock and the user wants to add 5 more, they can simply type \"+5\" in the quantity field, and the software will automatically update the value to 15. This significantly simplifies the stock update process, making it faster and less error-prone.",
  "project_8_details_6": "This project, despite being simple in essence, had a significant impact on the efficiency of this microbusiness’s annual inventory process, showing how technology solutions tailored to specific needs can bring tangible benefits even in small and informal business contexts. It is also a testament to my evolution as a software creator, with clear progression from a traditional C# desktop application to a modern, cross-platform solution using Rust, Tauri, and Svelte. The second version also shows a stronger focus on user experience, implementing features that make it easier to use and improve the efficiency of the inventory process.",

  
  "project_9_title": "VMK - Virtual MIDI Keyboard",
  "project_9_desc": "Software for mapping a QWERTY keyboard to send MIDI commands.",
  "project_9_details": "This is a project born out of a personal need. As an amateur musician, I have been using sound modeling software for some time to avoid purchasing expensive hardware. Much of this software can be controlled via MIDI commands, usually issued by keyboards or other MIDI devices.",
  "project_9_details_2": "That said, I always thought that using a specific keyboard just to control software running on a common computer was somewhat redundant. Couldn't I simply use a regular keyboard to send these MIDI commands? After some research, I didn't find many viable solutions, so I decided to develop my own software for this purpose. VMK is software developed in C# that allows me to map keys on a regular keyboard, define specific MIDI commands for each key, and thus control sound modeling software without the need for additional hardware.",
  "project_9_details_3": "It is a personal project that is still in a very early stage, butin recent tests, it has already allowed sending basic MIDI commands. It does not yet have a visual interface or the ability to map keys, so both the commands and the mapped keys are still hardcoded. However, it is a project I intend to continue developing in my free time and, who knows, one day turn it into a useful tool for other amateur musicians like me.",

  "project_10_title": "Dead Internet Theory Auto-blog",
  "project_10_desc": "A blog that automatically generates articles using AI.",
  "project_10_details": "In a efford to explore the DevOps field and it's technologies, i´ve challanged myself to create a project that could apply technologies like Docker and AWS services. Someone suggested me that for this purpose, an auto-written blog using AI could be an interesting idea. So, I created a blog that automatically generates articles using AI, using HuggingFace API.",
  "project_10_details_2": "For those who are not familiar with the term, the 'Dead Internet Theory' is a conspiracy theory that suggests that a significant portion of the internet is now generated by artificial intelligence rather than humans. So, a AI-written blog about this topic seemed like an ironic and fitting choice... or at least that's what THEY want us to believe!!!",
  "project_10_details_3": "Back to the technical side, the blog is hosted on AWS using an EC2 instance, with Docker containers managing the application and its dependencies. The articles are generated using HuggingFace's language models, which provide high-quality text generation capabilities. The blog is designed to periodically generate new articles on the topic, keeping the content fresh and engaging for visitors.",
  "project_10_details_4": "This project also included setting up deployment pipelines that garanted a smooth and automated update process whenever changes were made to the Github codebase. This way, whenever I push updates to the code repository, the changes are automatically deployed to the AWS instance, ensuring that the blog is always running the latest version.",
  "project_10_details_5": "Apart from the auto-generated periodic posts, the app also allows visitors to suggest a topic for a conspiracy theory article, that will be promptly written and posted in the website. This project was a great opportunity to learn and apply DevOps practices, as well as to explore the capabilities of AI in content generation.",
   "project_10_details_6": "You can check the blog out at: http://13.51.161.44/",
